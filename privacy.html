                <p><em>Effective Date: April 27, 2025</em></p>
                <p>At MoodTask, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle your information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our website and services. By using MoodTask, you agree to the practices outlined in this policy.</p>

                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: When you interact with our tools (e.g., Gratitude Note, Worry Shredder, Mood Tracking on the Dashboard, or Mood Music), you may provide information such as mood entries, notes, or music listening habits. This data is stored temporarily in your browser’s local storage to provide personalized recommendations and track your activity history (e.g., most played music category).</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We automatically collect anonymized information about your interactions with our website, including your IP address, browser type, pages visited, and time spent on activities. This data helps us improve our services and user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Analytics</strong>: We use third-party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to collect anonymized data about site usage. This helps us understand how users interact with MoodTask and improve our offerings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Embeds</strong>: Our Mood Music page embeds YouTube videos. When you interact with these embeds, YouTube may collect data about your activity as per their privacy policy. We recommend reviewing YouTube’s privacy practices for more details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: We use cookies to enhance your experience, such as remembering your preferences (e.g., navigation settings). You can manage cookie settings in your browser to opt-out of non-essential cookies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide personalized mood-based recommendations, activities, and music insights (e.g., suggesting tracks based on your listening habits).</li>
                    <li>Track your mood and activity history in your browser’s local storage for features like the Dashboard and Music Insights.</li>
                    <li>Improve our website and services through anonymized analytics and user feedback.</li>
                    <li>Communicate with you, if you opt-in to receive updates or support.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties, except as required by law, with your explicit consent (e.g., if you choose to explore affiliate links like Online Therapy or Mindfulness), or with trusted service providers who assist in operating our website (e.g., analytics providers, YouTube for video embeds), all of whom are bound by confidentiality agreements.</p>

                <h3>Data Security</h3>
                <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. Since most data is stored in your browser’s local storage, it is protected by your device’s security settings. For third-party services like YouTube embeds and analytics, we rely on their security practices. However, no online system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any sensitive information you provide.</p>

                <h3>Your Rights</h3>
                <p>You have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access or delete any personal information we have collected about you. Since most data is stored in your browser’s local storage (e.g., mood entries, music history), you can clear this data by clearing your browser cache.</li>
                    <li>Opt-out of cookies or other tracking technologies through your browser settings.</li>
                    <li>Review the privacy policies of third-party services (e.g., YouTube, Google Analytics, affiliate partners) to understand their data practices.</li>
