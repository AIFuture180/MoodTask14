                    <h3>Sleep</h3>
                    <p>Drift into a restful slumber with soothing tracks designed to help you fall asleep faster. Environmental psychologist Dr. Roger Ulrich’s research shows that slow-tempo music lowers heart rate and reduces stress hormones like cortisol, promoting better sleep quality. A 2018 study in the <em>Journal of Sleep Research</em> found that calming music reduced sleep onset time by 35% (Trahan et al., 2018). Tracks like "Waves Crashing" and "Calm Nature" use gentle rhythms to relax your mind. Perfect for bedtime, these tracks can be paired with our <a href="activities.html" style="color: #FFD700;">Progressive Muscle Relaxation</a> activity for a deeper unwind. Log your listening habits on our Dashboard to track their impact on your rest.</p>

                    <h3>Meditation</h3>
                    <p>Enhance your mindfulness practice with calm sounds tailored for meditation. Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, founder of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, notes that ambient music reduces stress by enhancing focus on the present moment. A 2020 study in <em>Mindfulness</em> found that meditation with background music lowered anxiety by 28% (Basso et al., 2020). Tracks like "Guided Meditation" and "Healing Meditation" provide serene soundscapes to deepen your practice. Use these during our <a href="activities.html" style="color: #FFD700;">Guided Meditation</a> activity for a more immersive experience. Ideal for morning or evening sessions, these tracks help you center yourself. Track your sessions on our Dashboard to see their benefits over time.</p>

                    <h3>Relaxation</h3>
                    <p>Unwind after a long day with relaxing melodies designed to soothe your mind and body. Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains that nature-inspired sounds, like those in "Nature Sounds" and "Water Sounds," activate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting a state of calm. A 2017 study in the <em>Journal of Environmental Psychology</em> found that relaxation music decreased stress by 21% (Nilsson et al., 2017). These tracks are perfect for evening wind-downs or during a break. Pair them with our <a href="activities.html" style="color: #FFD700;">Breathing Exercises</a> to amplify their calming effects.

                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Get energized with uplifting beats to boost your productivity and motivation. Neuroscientist Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett highlights that upbeat music increases dopamine levels, enhancing mood and drive. A 2019 study in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em> found that motivational music improved task performance by 18% (Thompson et al., 2019). Tracks like "Never Give Up" and "Epic Motivational" are perfect for starting your day or powering through a workout. Use them while engaging in our <a href="activities.html" style="color: #FFD700;">Nature Walk</a> activity to elevate your energy. Ideal for tackling challenging tasks, these tracks can be tracked on our Dashboard to see their impact on your productivity.</p>

                    <h3>Study</h3>
                    <p>Stay focused with tracks designed to enhance concentration during study or work sessions. Cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Amishi Jha’s research shows that alpha wave music, like in "Alpha Waves," improves attention by syncing brainwaves to a focused state. A 2021 study in <em>Brain and Cognition</em> found that background music increased focus by 22% during cognitive tasks (Lee et al., 2021). Tracks like "Peaceful Piano" and "Focus" create an ideal environment for deep work. Use these while practicing our <a href="activities.html" style="color: #FFD700;">Mindful Journaling</a> activity to reflect with clarity.

                <h2>Your Guide to Mood Music</h2>
                <p>Welcome to MoodTask’s Mood Music page, where we’ve curated a diverse collection of tracks to support your emotional well-being and enhance your daily activities. Music is a powerful tool for managing emotions, and our five categories—Sleep, Meditation, Relaxation, Motivation, and Study—are designed to meet your needs at any moment. Whether you’re winding down for the night, seeking focus for a study session, or looking for an energy boost to tackle your day, our carefully selected tracks provide the perfect backdrop. Each category is tailored to help you achieve a specific emotional state, from calming your mind to boosting your productivity. Dive in and discover how music can transform your mood and daily experience with MoodTask.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Mood Music Matters</h3>
                <p>Music has a profound effect on our brain and emotions, influencing everything from stress levels to productivity. Research shows that slow-tempo music can lower heart rate and cortisol levels, helping you relax or sleep better, as noted by environmental psychologist Dr. Roger Ulrich. A 2018 study in the <em>Journal of Sleep Research</em> found that calming music reduced sleep onset time by 35% (Trahan et al., 2018). On the other hand, upbeat tracks can increase dopamine, boosting motivation, according to neuroscientist Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett. A 2019 study in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em> showed that motivational music improved task performance by 18% (Thompson et al., 2019). Additionally, alpha wave music enhances focus by syncing brainwaves, as supported by a 2021 study in <em>Brain and Cognition</em> (Lee et al., 2021). At MoodTask, we’ve chosen tracks to leverage these benefits, ensuring you have the right music for every mood.</p>
                
                <h3>How to Use This Page</h3>
                <p>Using MoodTask’s Mood Music page is easy and intuitive. Start by clicking the "Explore Mood Music" button to reveal a variety of music categories. Each category, like Sleep or Motivation, offers a selection of tracks tailored to specific emotional needs. Click "Play Now" on a category card to open a popup, then choose a track—like "Waves Crashing" for Sleep or "Alpha Waves" for Study—and it will play in an embedded video player. You can log your listening habits to track which tracks work best for you over time on our <a href="dashboard.html">Dashboard</a>. Whether you’re unwinding, focusing, or seeking inspiration, explore all categories to find the perfect soundtrack for your moment. Let music guide you toward a more balanced day!</p>
                
                <h3>Maximizing Your Music Experience</h3>
                <p>To get the most out of MoodTask’s music, integrate it into your daily routine with intention.

Pair music with our <a href="activities.html">Activities</a> for a deeper experience—for example, listen to Meditation tracks during a Guided Meditation session to enhance mindfulness. Track your mood before and after listening on our Dashboard to identify patterns and discover which categories best support your emotional well-being. Experiment with different times of day and activities to see how music impacts your focus, relaxation, or energy. Over time, these tracks can become a powerful tool for emotional balance.</p>
